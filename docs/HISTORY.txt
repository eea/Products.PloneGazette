r71202
------
 - Added 4 new properties on NewsletterTheme: unsubscribeMailSubject, unsubscribeMailTemplate, confirmMailSubject, confirmMailTemplate
    - Subscriber receive and email after he unsubscribe, so he/she know that is no longer subscribed
    - When a subscriber choose to unsubscribe he/she receive an email containing an url with a unique unsubscribe
      link (similar to activation procedure) to confirm the unsubscribe, due to the fact that for example anyone can 
      unsubscribe someone if knows his/her email address
    - Similar to 'Subscriber activation mail subject' and 'Subscriber activation mail template', 4 new properties in 
      order to customize 'Confirm unsubscribe mail subject', 'Confirm unsubscribe mail template', 'Unsubscribe mail 
      subject' and 'Unsubscribe mail template'
   [alecghica]
 - Allow values for 'Newsletter author email' like: Author name <author@author.org> (see validate_newslettertheme_edit.vpy)
   [alecghica]
 - Use of NewsletterTheme.id instead of NewsletterTheme.absolute_url() used in newsletter template (see NewsletterTheme.py -> def subscribeFormProcess)
   [alecghica]
 - Disabled default batch view for all subscribers due the fact that for large amount of subscribers the batch view is very very slow. Use the search to
   find/list your subscribers. (see subscribers_infos.pt)
   [alecghica]
 - Implemented related items that can be associate to a newsletter (or to generate a newsletter upon an existing object)
   [alecghica]
