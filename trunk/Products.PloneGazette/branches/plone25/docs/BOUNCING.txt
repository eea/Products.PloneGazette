Removing bouncing subscribers
=============================

Note: Unless you have the external utility that can detect 
bouncing subscribers and make the call into PloneGazette,
you can safely ignore the Removal of Bouncing Subscribers
included in this version of PloneGazette.

As a rule, you don't want to send emails to bouncing subscribers. 
As of February 2010, this product has some support to automate
removing of those subscribers which are found to be bouncing. 

The goal was to minimize the impact on the existing system
architecture, so we have two pieces that need to be conected 
together:

1. Inside PloneGazette, the NewsletterTheme has now several
new fields.

	* the extra filters, which is a string field where you can
	  enter regular expressions (one per line), that can be used
		against the Delivery Status report found in returned email
		messages, to determine their bounciness.
	* the VERP prefix: this is a unique string that should be 
	  communicated to your SMTP administrator. He/she should setup
		the email server to receive messages for users who'se name
		contains that string
	* automatic cleanup: if enabled, will cause automatic removal
	  of subscribers which are found to be hard bouncing for a 
		number above a certain threshold (which is configurable in
		Products.PloneGazette.config)
	* the template of the email that will inform the subscribers
	  that they have been automatically removed

2. You need an external utility that can make the call into 
   PloneGazette informing it about the bouncing subscribers.
	 This is not included with PloneGazette.

Note: There are special upgrade requirements needed to enable
      the bouncing support in PloneGazette. Please read the
			instructions on upgrading to PG 2.5.1 to find out
			what you need to do.
