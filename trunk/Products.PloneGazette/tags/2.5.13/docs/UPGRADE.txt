PloneGazette - Upgrade notes
============================

Upgrade from PG25 3.0 unreleased to PG25 2.5.1
----------------------------------------------

* PG25 is the renamed PG 3.0 release compatible with Plone 2.5
* there are two portal_setup migration steps that need to be executed: 
* the types tool import step
* a special migration step called 
  "PloneGazette migrate to content types internal version 3"

You then need to go into your newsletter themes and manually edit the
newly added fields (related to bouncing handling setup).


Upgrade from PloneGazette 2.x to PloneGazette 3.0
-------------------------------------------------

o BACKUP YOUR SITE! Backup at least Data.fs (zope database)

o I personally tried ZEXP export NewsletterTheme object from Zope 2.9/Plone 2.5 and import 
  it to Zope2.10.4/Plone 3.0.3 and it worked. You can use other migration process, for example
  copy old Data.fs to new instance etc. Migration of Plone is described on 
  http://plone.org/upgrade 

o Go to portal_quickinstaller, locate PloneGazette, check the checkbox and reinstall product.
  All newsletter themes, newsletters and subscribers in your site will be migrated.
  
o After migration, all newsletters and newsletter themes may be in default workflow initial state
  (private, by default). To be users able to browse newsletter archives and sign in to newsletters, 
  you must publish all NewsletterTheme objects and Newsletters. Please check if your newsletters
  are accessible for your anoynmous users.
  
o Please be sure Subscribers folder (that one where your subscribers are stored) is NOT accessible
  by anonymous users. You can easily ensure it bu moving Subscribers folder to private state.
  
o Test your newsletters, test they are accessible for users, test sending of some newsletter to
  your test address (using the Test tab).
